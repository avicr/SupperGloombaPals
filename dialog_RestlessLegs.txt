'You! \n
Squatty, brown - why aren't you between your pipes?' \p
The shrill voice from above startled Gario. \n \n \n
'Well??' The turtle spat out, between bounces. \p
He'd been driven by instinct - he hadn't yet stuffed these massive, screeching thoughts into words. \n \n
'I...I think there must be more, than... \n \s ...than pipes.' \p
The turtle stopped his bouncing, and wrapped his tiny wings around in thought. \p
'One-One is the best of all possible Ones. It's the only One. \n \n \n
What could ever be gained by leaving?' \p
'All the same,' Gario replied, 'I want to see what's at the end.' \n \n
He began shuffling again, ever rightward. \p
The turtle shouted after Gario. \n
'There's nothing out there, you know, and even if - \n
\s \s \s - even if there is, you'll be squashed before you see it.' \p
Gario pressed on. \n \n
The turtle's voice was distant now. \n
Or maybe it was uncertainty, that had softened it. \p
'You'll be back, and... \n \n \n
\s \s ...and you'll tell \n me what you saw, won't you?'
