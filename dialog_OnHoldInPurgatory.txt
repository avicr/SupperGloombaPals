\s \s \s 'YOU HAVE DIED. \n \n \n
\s \s \s \s WELCOME BACK.' \p
The sign was the first thing Gario noticed - \n \n
then the drawbridge floor, and the neatly appointed castle-stone walls. \p
He finally caught the warm stare of a turtle at the room's far end. \n \n
'We're confused', it offered. A Question block appeared. \p
Gario stammered out that he didn't have the energy - \n \n 
just as well, the block interrupted with a pleasant 'ding!' \p
'This is our transition', stated the turtle, tenderly.\n \n \n
\s \s '...You were, then, and now you're not.' \p
Gario searched for a door - a flagpole, or a pipe - any clue as to an impending 'up' or 'down'. \n
'Where will I...' he began, as the turtle smiled. \p
'Just Our impression of you.' \n \n
\s \s \s '...we'll dream of your life, if that feels better.' \p
The turtle continued. \n \n
'We will Be whatever makes sense to us afterward.' \p
Gario blinked. \n \n
'I'll...My life will, be judged, and...' \p
'By Us - who else?' The turtle quipped. 'We are One. And one is Us.' \p
'One Godhead, and One infinite emanation. One Many, One unbounded individual. One...' \n
The turtle nodded expectantly to Gario. \n \n
\s \s \s \s \s \s \s \s \s \s '...One.' \p
He hadn't meant to reply. \p
'We're ready,' the Turtle proclaimed as he pulled the lever.
